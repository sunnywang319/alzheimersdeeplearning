Read my blog [here.](https://sunnywang319.github.io/alzheimersdeeplearning.html)  
The full paper can be found [here.](https://sunnywang319.github.io/fullpaper.pdf)

## To Run:
- Clone the repo
- Run all preprocessing files in the CNN folder (this will create a datasets folder)
- Run **train** ipynb files in the GAN folder
- Run**generate** ipynb files in the GAN folder
- Run all ipynb files in the CNN folder

## To do:
- Improve preprocessing consistency among slices
- Implement WGAN and DCGAN
- Test sagittal and coronal slices for one input CNN
- Use GANs with original image resolution
- MRI PET Fusion
